This is intended to eventually form a real-time strategy game, combining elements found in Starcraft and Mindustry, particularly Starcraft's controllable units, and Mindustry's tower-defense aspects.

Neither of these aspects is intended to be able to completely overpower the other. For example, units should be able to destroy towers, but not without either micromanagement, considerable losses, or both.
